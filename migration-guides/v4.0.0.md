## v4.0.0 Migration Guide

The only breaking change in this version is that the `endpoint` argument to `before` hooks has been renamed to `url`. This will only affect projects where a `before` hook is being used to modify the request url:

```diff
- function before ({ endpoint }) {
-  return { endpoint: transform(endpoint) }
- }

+ function before ({ url }) {
+  return { url: transform(url) }
+ }

const http = configureHttp({ before })
```
